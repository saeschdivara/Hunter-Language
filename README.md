## Goals

We want to be able to write the compiler in our own language. So what do we need for this:

1. [ ] Function parameters
1. [ ] Better if / else (especially string support)
2. [x] Loops for and while
3. [ ] File interaction (read / write)
4. [ ] String operations
5. [ ] C-Libraries integration / using functions from any arbitrary library (using c call convention)
