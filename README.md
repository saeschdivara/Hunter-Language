## Goals

We want to be able to write the compiler in our own language. So what do we need for this:

1. [x] Function calls
1. [x] Function parameters
1. [x] Function return values
1. [x] Single line comments
1. [x] Better if / else (especially string support)
2. [x] Loops for and while
4. [x] Support of modules (simple version)
5. [x] C-Libraries integration / using functions from any arbitrary library (using c call convention)
3. [x] Structs
3. [ ] External structs
3. [ ] Pointers
3. [ ] Custom type validation (parameter and return values)
3. [ ] Traits and their implementation
4. [ ] String operations
3. [ ] File interaction (read / write)
5. [ ] Debug information (in progress)
